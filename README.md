Jenkins Pipeline: Deploy to Amazon EKS
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete end-to-end process of deploying applications to a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) using a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline automates the creation of infrastructure, deployment of applications, and the teardown of resources, ensuring a smooth and efficient deployment process.

Project Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

AWS Account: An active AWS account with permissions to create EC2 instances, EKS clusters, and other resources.
AWS CLI: Installed and configured with access to your AWS account.
Jenkins: Basic understanding of Jenkins and its pipeline functionalities.
SSH Key Pair: Existing SSH key pair in the region where you’ll be deploying the infrastructure.
Project Setup and Steps
Step 1: Create an AWS Key Pair
Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard in your AWS Management Console.
Under Network & Security, select Key Pairs.
Click Create Key Pair.
Provide a name for your key pair, select the format, and create it. Ensure this key pair is stored securely as it will be required to access your Jenkins server and other EC2 instances.
Step 2: Set Up Jenkins Server
Launch an EC2 instance: Choose an Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu AMI with the necessary specs.
Install Jenkins:
Update the instance: sudo yum update -y or sudo apt update.
Install Jenkins: Follow official Jenkins installation guide for the specific OS.
Install required dependencies such as Java, Git, Docker, kubectl, and aws-cli.
Start Jenkins and ensure it’s running: sudo systemctl start jenkins.
Configure Jenkins to start on boot: sudo systemctl enable jenkins.
Step 3: Access and Configure Jenkins
Access Jenkins: Use your web browser to access Jenkins via the public IP of the EC2 instance at http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8080.
Initial Setup:
Unlock Jenkins using the initial password found at /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword.
Install suggested plugins or any additional plugins required for AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.
Set up your first admin user and complete the setup wizard.
Configure Jenkins Credentials:
Add AWS credentials (Access Key and Secret Access Key).
Add your SSH key pair for accessing other EC2 instances.
Configure Docker and Kubernetes plugins if necessary.
Step 4: Deploy to EKS using Jenkins Pipeline
Create Jenkins Pipeline: Set up a Jenkins pipeline job that pulls the jenkins-pipeline-deploy-to-eks repository.
Pipeline Script:
The pipeline should automate the following tasks:
Create an Amazon EKS Cluster: Provision an EKS cluster using eksctl or Terraform.
Deploy Applications: Define Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files, and deploy them to the EKS cluster.
Configure CI/CD: Automate the build, test, and deployment stages using Jenkins.
Trigger the Pipeline: Start the Jenkins pipeline and monitor the process as it provisions the infrastructure, deploys the application, and configures the services.
Step 5: Test the Application
Access the Application:
Once the deployment is successful, retrieve the external IP or DNS of the service.
Access the application in your web browser to confirm that it is running as expected.
Verify Deployments:
Use kubectl get pods, kubectl get services, etc., to ensure that all pods and services are up and running correctly.
Step 6: Destroy the Infrastructure
Teardown Resources:
After testing, the Jenkins pipeline should include a stage to destroy the EKS cluster and any associated AWS resources.
Ensure that all resources are properly terminated to avoid unnecessary charges.
Verify Cleanup:
Manually check the AWS Management Console to ensure that all resources created during the deployment are deleted.
Conclusion
This project illustrates how to automate the deployment of applications to a Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS using Jenkins. By following these steps, you’ll gain hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and AWS, empowering you to manage and deploy applications efficiently.
